# â‡‰ðŸ“ºâ‡‰ pyscFilteredViewer

This is a helper-script for Notepad++ using PythonScript.  It runs the active file in Notepad++ through a filter to convert it to HTML, then launches that HTML in the default browser.  This filtering process can be run automatically with every save of your file in Notepad++, or you can do it just on-demand.

This is useful for code that has embedded documentation that can be easily extracted and rendered to HTML (such as POD in Perl), or when editing marked-up text like a Markdown file.  Anything that you can meaningfully convert to HTML, where you want to be able to edit the non-HTML source but render the final HTML in your browser is fair game.

## Installation

### Installation Prerequsisites

* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) -- text editor with plugin capability
* [PythonScript](https://github.com/bruderstein/PythonScript/) -- a plugin for Notepad++ which can be used to automate tasks inside Notepad++ using Python 2.7

### Installation Procedure

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/pryrt/pyscFilteredViewer/releases/latest) of pyscFilteredViewer from [https://github.com/pryrt/pyscFilteredViewer/releases/latest](https://github.com/pryrt/pyscFilteredViewer/releases/latest).
2. Extract the `pyscFilteredViewer` folder from the zipfile into the PythonScript `scripts\` location:
    * `%AppData%\Notepad++\plugins\config\PythonScript\scripts\pyscFilteredViewer\ ` is the most common location.
    * If you have a portable version of Notepad++, or if you want these scripts to be available to all users on the machine, rather than just the current user, please see [docs/AlternateInstall.md](docs/AlternateInstall.md)
3. If you had Notepad++ open, close and reload Notepad++ .
    * This will cause Notepad++ and PythonScript to see the new scripts
    * You can see them in the **Plugins > PythonScript > Scripts** menu
4. Run **Plugins > PythonScript > Scripts > pyscFilteredViewer > pyscfvEditConfig** to configure this utility: see [**Configuration**](#configuration) (below) for configuration details

### Scripts

* `pyscFilteredViewerLibrary.py` -- this is the main library, which all the other scripts will use.  Not intended for being run directly as a PythonScript script
* `pyscfvEditConfig.py` -- running this script will load the `psycFilteredViewer.ini` file, and allow you to edit it (see [**Configuration**](#configuration), below)
* `pyscFilteredViewer.py` -- running this script will do a one-time filter of the active file (see [**One-time Filtering**](#one-time-filtering), below)
* `pyscfvToggleFilterOnSave.py` -- running this script will toggle between running the filter any time the file is saved and not running it (equivalent to choosing the correct version of pyscfvRegisterFilterOnSave or pyscfvUnRegisterFilterOnSave) (see [**Filter On Save**](#filter-on-save), below)
* `pyscfvRegisterFilterOnSave.py` -- this will set up Notepad++ to run the filter any time any file is saved (see [**Filter On Save**](#filter-on-save), below)
* `pyscfvUnRegisterFilterOnSave.py` -- this will stop Notepad++ from running the filter any time any file is saved (see [**Filter On Save**](#filter-on-save), below)

## Configuration

The first time you run any of the scripts (I recommend `pyscfvEditConfig` as the first of these scripts you run), it will create a configuration file called `pyscFilteredViewer.ini`.  (If it finds a PreviewHTML `filters.ini` file, it will copy that to the new location and name.  See [**Inspiration / Justification** (below)](#inspiration--justification) for the connection with PreviewHTML.)

The configuration file is used to set the filter-command on a per-file-type basis (where a file-type is based on either the **Language** that Notepad++ has set for the file, or the file extension).  Each file-type needs its own section in the config file.

The default configuration file looks something like:

    ; pyscFilteredViewer Config File (compatible with PreviewHTML Filters.ini file)
    ; Everything after ; are comments, and will help you read/understand the ini file
    [IniFile]                                          ;   => this is the name of the section; it must be unique.  Typically, based on the language
    Extension=.ini .cfg                                ;   => space-separated list of filename extensions, including the period.
    Language=INI                                       ;   => this is the name of the language (from Notepad++'s perspective): for a UDL, use your "UserName" from the UDL dialog
    ; the 'Command=' line below is the filter command;
    ;   the first part of the command should be the full path to the command
    ;       if it has spaces in the path, it MUST have quotes around it
    ;       if it does not have spaces in the path, it still MAY have quotes around it
    ;   %1 is the name of the active file/buffer; it is in quotes "%1" because the path might contain spaces, and windows needs the quotes to know it's a single filename
    ;   the command must result in the HTML being dumped to STDOUT
    Command="%AppData%\Notepad++\Plugins\Config\pyscFilteredViewer\ExampleConverterCommand.bat" "%1"
    ; this example command just wraps the text of the INI file in HTML XMP tags, so the browser will render it as plaintext inside an HTML file

* **[SECTION]**: each section in the config file is a logical grouping, which will define the filter command for a given file-type. The section name chosen is irrelevant, as long as it is unique.  It is recommended that it be similar to the **Language** setting
    * example â‡’ `[IniFile]`
* **Extension**: this setting is a space-separated list of filename extensions (including the period/dot)
    * example â‡’ `Extension=.ini .cfg`
* **Language**: this is the name of the "language" of the file (Notepad++ calls the file-type "Language", since it's often a programming language, like "Python" or "Perl")
    * If you want this to work for a User Defined Language (UDL), use whatever name you saved it as from the **Language > Define Your Language** dialog, **Save As...** button
    * example â‡’ `Language=INI` -- this assumes Notepad++ calls the language for .ini files "INI" (it does in my versions)
* **Command**: this is the command to use to filter the file into HTML.
    * This command should take the name of a file as the command-line argument, and should output HTML to `STDOUT`.
      * You can look at the `ExampleConverterCommand.bat`, which unzipped in the same folder as the python scripts, for an example of a batch file that takes the filename as an argument and outputs to the
      * Many converters (markdown-to-HTML, POD-to-HTML, etc) follow this filename-in/STDOUT-out by default
    * To reference the filename of the source file (ie, the file that's in Notepad++), use `%1`.  Since the file's path and or name may have a space, it is highly recommended to always enclose it in quotes, as `"%1"`
    * The path to the command (executable, batch file, or anything else "runnable" from a Windows perspective) should be spelled out, as it is likely not in your PATH
    * This is not the browser (or other viewer) command.  The viewer used is based on your Windows settings, whatever the default / open "action" is for the HTML file type (usually your default web browser).
    * example â‡’ `Command="%AppData%\Notepad++\Plugins\Config\pyscFilteredViewer\ExampleConverterCommand.bat" "%1"`

**NOTE**: you technically only need one of either **Language** or **Extension**, since one is usually enough to define a file-type.  But if both are defined, pyscFilteredViewer will first try to match on **Language**, and then on **Extension**.

### Configuring Keyboard Shortcut(s)

If you want to be able to use one or more of these scripts with a keyboard shortcut, use the **Plugins > PythonScript > Configuration...** dialog to add the script(s) to the **Menu items** list, then **Settings > Shortcut Mapper > Plugin Commands**, filter for **Python**, and edit the keyboard shortcut for the appropriate script(s).

Once you are ready to replace PreviewHTML with `pyscFilteredViewer`, I highly recommend mapping the PreviewHTML shortcut (`Ctrl+H`) to `pyscfvToggleFilterOnSave` (see [**Filter On Save**](#filter-on-save), below).

## Filtering

You can either filter your file on demand, using [One-time Filtering](#one-time-filtering), or you can make it filter every time you hit SAVE in Notepad++ using [Filter On Save](#filter-on-save).

### One-time Filtering

This will take the active file, filter it as defined in the **Configuration**, and the resulting filtered file will be displayed in your default browser.  With one-time filtering, it will immediately delete the temporary HTML file -- so if you try to hit RELOAD or REFRESH in your browser or viewer, it won't find the file.  To reload the file, you will need to close the old version in your viewer, and re-run the one-time filter from Notepad++.

### Filter On Save

If you want to keep updating the filtered file (usually HTML) every time you change the source, you need to "register" the FilterOnSave action, using the `pyscfvRegisterFilterOnSave` script.  This will register a "hook" such that every time Notepad++ saves a file, it will run the filter.  If the filter hasn't been run on this file yet, it will launch the filtered file in the appropriate viewer.  If the filter had been run on this file before, then **you** will have to move to the viewer (usually, the web browser) and refresh the appropriate page (or find a browser or viewer that can watch for changes in the file, and automatically refresh itself).

Once you are done (or want to be able to edit and save files without having the filter run every time), you can use `pyscfvUnRegisterFilterOnSave` to un-register / un-hook the filter from the file-save event.

As an easier interface (and the one I recommend), you can use the `pyscfvToggleFilterOnSave` script to automatically determine whether it should enable or disable the FilterOnSave.  Using this script to toggle filtering to the temporary file is the most like the PreviewHTML behavior, and it's the script I have associated with PreviewHTML's `Ctrl+H` keyboard shortcut.

As a bonus feature, to help you keep track of whether or not the filter is on, the Status Bar will be edited to show `â‡‰ðŸ“ºâ‡‰` before the Language name when the live filter is active, and will remove that prefix when the filtering is turned off.

* The manual refresh in the viewer/browser is a known compromise in the switch from PreviewHTML to pyscFilteredViewer: there may be a way to cause your viewer (browser) to reload/refresh the appropriate file, but it wasn't immediately obvious.  As a workaround, you may be able to define your filter to include the `<meta refresh>` tag in the resulting HTML, which might work for a local file to cause refresh as often as you want; I do not guarantee that this workaround work for you.

* If there is enough demand, it would be possible to add other hooks (and accompanying scripts to register or unregister the hooks) I may add another possible hook to register, which might be something like the time-based FilterOnTimer or the buffer-edited

## Inspiration / Justification

### PreviewHTML
This was inspired by the [PreviewHTML](http://fossil.2of4.net/npp_preview) plugin for Notepad++, which was designed to embed an HTML-previewer in Notepad++.  But the more-useful-to-me feature was that you could apply a filter program to the current file, and it would filter into HTML, which would then be rendered in the PreviewHTML window.  Unfortunately, PreviewHTML hasn't been updated to work with 64-bit Notepad++ (though the developer has been working on it on and off for more than a year, as of Jan 2019), and I'd really like to transition to 64bit as my main editor.

Since I primarily care about the filter-to-a-viewer format, and would be willing to use an external viewer (like my default web browser), I realized I could implement the pass-the-current-file-through-a-filter feature using PythonScript, and then launch the filtered HTML file in the user's default web browser.

I have kept the configuration file compatbile with PreviewHTML's `filters.ini` -- and, in fact, if you already have that plugin installed, **pyscFilteredViewer** will copy the PreviewHTML `filters.ini` configuration file for its own use

### Pork2Sausage

It has been pointed out to me that this is also similar to Don Ho's [Pork2Sausage plugin](https://github.com/npp-plugins/pork2sausage), which is one of the developer's demonstration plugins for Notepad++.  Pork2Sausage will grab the contents of the active file, run a conversion on those contents, and overwrite the old version with the new: this is great for encoding or decoding base64 text, or similar actions, where you want it to happen in-place.  But when you are editing a Markdown document, and want to see what the equivalent HTML looks like in your browser, you don't want to replace the Markdown; when editing Perl source code, and just want to render the embedded POD as HTML, you don't want to replace the whole script with the HTML.

## Future Features

Some day, there may be:

* ability to configure an alternate viewer -- either by specifying a Windows "verb" other than the default, or by giving a path to the program that should be used to view the file

* ability to filter to something other than HTML -- it's almost there... it just defaults the name to .html; if I make the filtered-extension configurable, then everything else should just come out nicely in the wash

Feel free to make [feature suggestions and bug reports](https://github.com/pryrt/pyscFilteredViewer/issues).  I do not guarantee they will make it in, but if I can think of a way to do it (or if you help with the development), there's a good chance I'll incorporate it.
